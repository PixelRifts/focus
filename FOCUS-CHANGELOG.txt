# KNOWN BUGS

- (IMPORTANT) Sometimes when pulling changes via Git, the editor won't notice the files changing
- Changing some keymap bindings requires a restart to take effect


# Main Git Branch

+ When a file is created in the editor, its saving and hot-reloading should now work properly
+ The example config file has been stripped down to avoid confusion


# RELEASES ==================================================================

# Version 0.1.4, 1 May 2023

+ Basic Linux Support (thanks to @ileonte)
+ Added crash reports on failed asserts and violated array bounds
+ Smooth scrolling is fixed
+ Config hot reload should work even if it's within one of the ignored dirs
+ On Windows files with path longer than 248 bytes will be ignored to avoid a crash (probably a temporary solution)


# Version 0.1.3, 30 April 2023

+ Fixed a bug with the file watcher being used while uninitialized.
+ Added some shortcuts to the unsaved files dialog (Y/S to save, N to not save, C to cancel)
+ Fixed a bug with the biggest monitor being incorrectly determined on Windows (thanks to @jlami)
+ Zooming no longer offsets the viewport
+ Editing the same file side-by-side will not cause the viewport to jump around


# Version 0.1.2, 29 April 2023

+ File errors are not too dim any more


# Version 0.1.1, 28 April 2023

+ Added a Save All command
+ Fixed 2 crashes
