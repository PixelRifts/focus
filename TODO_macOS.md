# TODO macOS

Major Bugs
    - Resizing the window squishes the interface (update_window is not being called on resize events or something)
    - Setting Cursor-as-Block to false makes the cursor invisible
    - (Mouse) Scrolling in the text view does not work.

Unimplemented
    -

Minor Bugs
    - IBeam cursor does not reset to Normal when hovering over the window title bar or bottom filename/line/col bar

Would Be Nice Eventually
    - Smooth Mac-style inertia scrolling
